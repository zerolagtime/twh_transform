# TWH Transforms

The HTML in this page is for a GitHub Pages website that
transforms one or more pieces of the site into another
structure.

No code is transferred to a server.  All content stays 
in the browser.

## Calendar Bar Transform
This first application is meant to transform the
quick summary calendar bar on the front page into
a format usable in a publishing app for a newsletter
tool like Microsoft Publisher.

Entries in the menu look like
```txt
Troop Meeting
(May 4 2024 6:00PM)
```

and come out looking something like
|   |
| -- |
| __**May**__ |
| 4   Troop Meeting - 6pm |

Markdown doesn't do a great job of exact presentation, but it should be easy to copy and paste all of the upcoming events in one swoop.

The app comes with a one-click button to copy all of the text for transferring to 
the publishing app.
